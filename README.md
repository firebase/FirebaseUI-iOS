# FirebaseUI for iOS â€” UI Bindings for Firebase [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS)

FirebaseUI is an open-source library for iOS that allows you to quickly connect common UI elements to the [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com?utm_source=FirebaseUI-iOS) database for data storage, allowing views to be updated in realtime as they change, and providing simple interfaces for common tasks like displaying lists or collections of items.

Additionally, FirebaseUI simplifies Firebase authentication by providing easy to use auth methods that integrate with common identity providers like Facebook, Twitter, and Google as well as allowing developers to use a built in headful UI for ease of development.

FirebaseUI clients are also available for [Android](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-Android) and [web](https://github.com/firebase/firebaseui-web).

## Installing FirebaseUI for iOS

FirebaseUI supports iOS 8.0+. We recommend using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/pods/FirebaseUI), add
the following to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'FirebaseUI', '~> 5.0'       # Pull in all Firebase UI features
```

If you don't want to use all of FirebaseUI, there are multiple subspecs which can selectively install subsets of the full feature set:

```ruby
# Only pull in FirebaseUI Firestore features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Firestore', '~> 5.0'

# Only pull in FirebaseUI Database features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Database', '~> 5.0'

# Only pull in FirebaseUI Storage features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Storage', '~> 5.0'

# Only pull in FirebaseUI Auth features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Auth', '~> 5.0'

# Only pull in Facebook login features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Facebook', '~> 5.0'

# Only pull in Google login features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Google', '~> 5.0'

# Only pull in Phone Auth login features
pod 'FirebaseUI/Phone', '~> 5.0'
```

If you're including FirebaseUI in a Swift project, make sure you also have:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!
```

Otherwise, you can download the latest version of the [FirebaseUI frameworks from the releases
page](https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS/releases) or include the FirebaseUI
Xcode project from this repo in your project. You also need to [add the Firebase
framework](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup) to your project.

## Documentation

The READMEs for components of FirebaseUI can be found in their respective
project folders.

- [Auth](Auth/README.md)
- [PhoneAuth](PhoneAuth/README.md)
- [Database](Database/README.md)
- [Firestore](Firestore/README.md)
- [Storage](Storage/README.md)

## Local Setup

If you'd like to contribute to FirebaseUI for iOS, you'll need to run the
following commands to get your environment set up:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/firebase/FirebaseUI-iOS.git
$ cd FirebaseUI-iOS
$ pod install
```

Alternatively you can use `pod try FirebaseUI` to install the Objective-C or Swift sample projects.

## Sample Project Configuration

You'll have to configure your Xcode project in order to run the samples.

1. Your Xcode project should contain a `GoogleService-Info.plist`, downloaded from [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com) when you add your app to a Firebase project.<br>
Copy the `GoogleService-Info.plist` into the sample project folder (`samples/obj-c/GoogleService-Info.plist` or `samples/swift/GoogleService-Info.plist`).

1. Update URL Types.<br>
Go to `Project Settings -> Info tab -> Url Types` and update values for:
	+ `REVERSED_CLIENT_ID` (get value from `GoogleService-Info.plist`)
	+ `fb{your-app-id}` (put Facebook App Id)

1. Update `Info.plist` with Facebook configuration values
	+ `FacebookAppID -> {your-app-id}` (put Facebook App Id)

1. Enable Keychain Sharing.<br>
Facebook SDK requires keychain sharing.<br>
This can be done here: `Project Settings -> Capabilities -> KeyChain Sharing -> ON`

1. Don't forget to configure your Firebase App Database using [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com).<br>
Database should contain appropriate read/write permissions and folders (`objc_demo-chat` and `swift_demo-chat` respectively)

1. In Order to use `Phone Auth` provider you should [Configure Push Notifications](#configure-apple-push-notifications)

#### Configure Apple Push Notifications

##### Enable silent push notifications in Xcode

  * `Push Notification` - Under `Capabilities` tab in your app target choose `Push Notifications` and put the switch to the `On` position.
  * `Background Mode` - Under `Capabilities` tab in your app target choose `Background Modes` put the switch to the `On` position.  In the list of available modes select `Background fetch` and `Remote notifications` (If available).

##### Upload APNS Certificate to Firebase

1. Create your `Provisioning APNS SSL Certificates` by following the steps on the following link.
https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging/ios/certs

1. Upload your `APNS Certificate` to Firebase:
    + Inside your project in the Firebase console, select the gear icon, select `Project Settings`, and then select the `Cloud Messaging` tab.
    + Select the `Upload Certificate` button for your development certificate, your production certificate, or both. At least one is required.
    + For each certificate, select the `.p12 file`, and provide the password, if any. Make sure the `bundle ID` for this certificate matches the `bundle ID` of your app. Select `Save`.
